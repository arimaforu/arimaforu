# Hi, I'm arimaforu 👋

I’m a developer explorer diving into the world of code, from modern Python automation to the low-level mysticism of HolyC.

### 🚀 The Roadmap
- 🐍 **Python:** Currently mastering the basics and scripting.
- 🕊️ **HolyC:** Descending into the 64-bit TempleOS architecture.
- 🌐 **Web:** Maintaining my digital home at [arimadev.ru](https://arimadev.ru)

### 🛠 My Battle Stations
* **Laptop:** `MacBook Air M2` (For coding on the go & Python study)
* **Desktop:** `Intel i5-12400F | RTX 4060 | 32GB RAM` (For heavy lifting and HolyC VMs)
